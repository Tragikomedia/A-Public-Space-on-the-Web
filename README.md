# A Public Space on the Web

This a project based on the last exercise of [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html)'s ch. 20 (also titled A Public Space on the Web). The project consists of two parts, the first one (located in the main directory) is a Node.js-based server that responds to the requests done by the second part - a website. The server enables users to meddle with the code behind the website from inside the website, using a relatively user-friendly GUI.

## Running the project

If you don't know how to run it, you should check out Eloquent JS linked above.
